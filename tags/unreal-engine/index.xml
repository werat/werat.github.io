They were minding their own business and playing with Unreal Engine 5 when suddenly a wild build error appeared and said that some precompiled headers are out of date:
fatal error: file &amp;#39;D:\toolchain\sysroot\usr\include\x86_64-linux-gnu\bits\wordsize.h&amp;#39; has been modified since the precompiled header &amp;#39;UE5\Engine\...\SharedPCH.CoreUObject.ShadowErrors.h.gch&amp;#39; was built: mtime changed Hmm, well, it looks like some source files have changed and a simple re-build would fix the issue.</description></item></channel></rss>
