Time to share some details!
Debugging Wine applications is tricky and there are different ways to do it. In many cases you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to the application source code and/or debug symbols and Wine itself is often built with aggressive optimizations.</description></item><item><title>How Wine works 101</title><link>https://werat.dev/blog/how-wine-works-101/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2022 21:20:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://werat.dev/blog/how-wine-works-101/</guid><description>Wine is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, &amp;amp; BSD (https://www.winehq.org).
If you have been using Linux for some time now, chances are you’ve used Wine at some point. Maybe to run that one very important Windows program that doesn’t have a Linux version or maybe to play World of Warcraft or some other game. Fun fact, Valve&amp;rsquo;s Steam Deck uses a Wine-based solution to run games (called Proton).</description></item><item><title>How to debug deadlocks in Visual Studio</title><link>https://werat.dev/blog/how-to-debug-deadlocks-in-visual-studio/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Sep 2022 12:21:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://werat.dev/blog/how-to-debug-deadlocks-in-visual-studio/</guid><description>There has been lots of discussions recently about the usefulness of debuggers (on Twitter/Reddit and probably other platforms). Some people brag about never using/needing one and some people can&amp;rsquo;t imagine their life without stepping through the code line by line. I&amp;rsquo;m both of these people at different times, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to judge anyone. Instead, let me share a short debugging story and you can decide for yourself :)</description></item><item><title>Blazing fast expression evaluation for C++ in LLDB</title><link>https://werat.dev/blog/blazing-fast-expression-evaluation-for-c-in-lldb/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://werat.dev/blog/blazing-fast-expression-evaluation-for-c-in-lldb/</guid><description>Expression evaluation is an integral part of any modern debugger. It allows the user to inspect the program state using the familiar syntax of the target language, as well as perform modifications to the target process (if the side-effects are allowed). If you have ever used command-line debuggers, you&amp;rsquo;re probably familiar with it via commands like print/call in GDB or expr/p in LLDB. It is also used extensively by the IDEs to support typical UI workflows: Immediate Window, Watch Window, hovering over a variable, custom data visualizers (see NatVis), etc.</description></item><item><title>Debugging LLDB with source stepping</title><link>https://werat.dev/blog/debugging-lldb-with-source-stepping/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2020 18:35:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://werat.dev/blog/debugging-lldb-with-source-stepping/</guid><description>Sometimes you want to (or need to) debug a program that you didn&amp;rsquo;t build yourself and you don&amp;rsquo;t even know how exactly it was built. Depending on the specifics of your setup that could mean many different things:
Built on a build farm, running on a production server/container Installed via apt or similar, running locally &amp;hellip; This post is inspired by my experience of debugging LLDB. Debugging the debugger is always interesting and tricky, even without the additional difficulties like trying to get the source stepping to work :)</description></item></channel></rss>
